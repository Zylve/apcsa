2. What part(s) of the project did you find easy? What part(s) of the project did you find
challenging? How did you overcome the challenges?

I found it very easy to convert the iteractive program into a simulator program. I found it quite
difficult to work out the logic of the monty hall problem but I was able to use the debugger to
figure out how my code is working under the hood and correct any issues.

3. Who did you collaborate with for this project (if any)? What did you help each other
with?

I did not collaborate with anybody.

Evaluation
Program Specifications
Part 1
‚Ä¢ Program prompts user input and prints all required
information // Prompts Input and prints information (including the door number that the user will switch to).
‚Ä¢ Program checks user input and handles invalid input // Program tells user if there is incorrect input and prompts them to restart.
‚Ä¢ Program implements the Monty Hall problem correctly // Monty Hall problem is implemented correctly üëç.
Part 2
‚Ä¢ Program uses the loop correctly to run 100 trials // Runs 100 trials, 50 for switching, 50 for not switching
‚Ä¢ Program implements the Monty Hall problem correctly // Implemented correctly.
‚Ä¢ Program displays the correct winning percentages // Displays winning percentages in a readable format.
Programming Practice
‚Ä¢ Use of easy-to-understand variable names // Variable names are not ambiguous.
‚Ä¢ Clear comments in the program // Comments available
